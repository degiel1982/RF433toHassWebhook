This is a RF433 bridge that will send a webhook to home assistant.


<h1>This is still in WIP</h1>

20-12-2023:
I created the code together with chagpt. This is not fully well build but it works as intended.
I am going to improve and optimize the code. help is always welcome :)

TODO:
- At first time run it should go to a standard ssid and password.
- There must be a config page that will let you set the credentials
- Opzimize the code. at every webhooksend now it will load the spiffs file every time but i need that in memory after boot+
- The webpage needs to bee cleaner and more optimized
